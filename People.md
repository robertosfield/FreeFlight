# Robert Osfield

Veteran open source real-time graphics middleware developer/software consultant. Project lead of [VulkanSceneGraph](https://vsg-dev.github.io/vsg-dev.io/) and [OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.com) projects.

Learned to fly hang gliders in 1987 and flew through to early 2000's when young family and work associated with the above projects became too overwhelming to have free time to keep flying. Plan to return to flying in near future. Accumulated ~750 hours of airtime on a range of gliders that include:
* Middas E
* Hiway Superscorp
* Hiway Demon
* Lamouette Azur, later heavily modified to near 100% double surface and wing warping.
* Various prototypes when working at AIRWAVE Gliders.
* Klassic 12m

Education: 1988-92 Engineering and Computer Science at Oxford University, awarded top first for 3rd and 4th year projects both related to hang glider design and modelling.
