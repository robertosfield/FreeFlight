# FreeFlight
Hub for freely sharing knowledge and development of light-weight soaring and powered aircraft, eqiupmnent and software.

## Open Lincesing of articles, designs and software

Following the approach of open source software development this FreeFLight initialiive adopts both the open licensing of hardware desgins and software, as well as the community based approach of freely sharing knowledges, ideas and designs.  

As is standard woth open source software licensing the sharing of knowledge, ideas and designs is done on the basis that no liability is conferred 

The designs and software may be used for commericial prodicts, free of charge, but on use of designs and software entities may not pursue or enforce patente relating to these designs or software.
