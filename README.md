# FreeFlight
Hub for freely sharing knowledge and development of light-weight soaring and powered aircraft, eqiupmnent and software.

This project is intended primarily for engineers, both professional and enthusiasts, developing new personal aircraft, related equiptment and software. The uniting passionn will be for achieving safe personal flight leveraging shared knowledge, latest designs and taking avanntage of modern materials and systems that are now available to us.

## Open Lincesing of articles, designs and software

Following the approach of open source software development this FreeFLight initialiive adopts both the open licensing of hardware desgins and software, as well as the community based approach of freely sharing knowledges, ideas and designs.  

As is standard with open source software licensing the sharing of knowledge, ideas and designs is done on the basis that no liability is conferred 

The designs and software may be used for commericial products, free of charge, but on use of designs and software provided may not pursue or enforce patente relating to these designs or software.

### Example sub-projects that could be hosted under the Free-Flight project

* Currating of useful 3rd party resources on aerodynamics, structures, control and propulsion systems
* Airworthiness - detailing exisiting airworthiness testing and proposing improvments and new schemes
* Archive of historical designs
* Harnesss development
* Instrument development
* Engineering related software development
* Visual simulation & training software development
* Helmet/head mounted instrument/augement reality systems - vario, altimeter, navigation, communication, trackers, black box through to artifical horizons. 
* Indvidual aircraft projects:
  - hang glider(s)
  - sub 70kg powered hang gliders - trike
  - sub 70kg powered hang gliders - foot launched
  - electrical motor and batteries systems
  - eSTOL personal/cargo aircraft
  - eVTOL personal/cargo aircraft
